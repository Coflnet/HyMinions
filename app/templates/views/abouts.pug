        h1 ABOUT ME
        p Hello, I have been playing Hypixel Skyblock since the first week of its release. I noticed that it's very important to get updated with the most profitable minions, so I decided to make a calculator myself.
        
        h2 Minion calculator
        .row
            .col-md-9.col-12
                p.
                    It calculates the profit generated by each minion.
                p.
                    What's so special is that it allows you to fully personalize its elements to become your very own minion tier list based on your profile, which include minion tiers, form of products (even in e-block form!), whether or not diamond spreadings are equipped, and more.
                p.
                    It also calculates the profit based on bazaar prices directly obtained from the Hypixel API, so the prices are up-to-date.
                br
                p.
                    To use it, go to the <a href="/minions">minions tab</a>. Type in your Minecraft IGN in the first input box (or simply leave it if you have fully maxed minions), and click "Apply Overall Changes". You will then see a list of all minions, ranked by the amount of profit it generates. The number below each minion is the profit per hour, assuming you sell the items to the bazaar. You can also see the item(s) each minion gives.
                p.
                    The default settings should be fine for most of you. Of course you can try out different settings based on your very own playstyle.

        h2 Events timer
        p This is the page that shows the time remaining to regular SkyBlock events.
        p To use it, go to the <a href="/events">events tab</a>. Live events are shown in yellow. The large countdown timers show the time left until the next events/ time left until the events end. The bracketed dates and times show when the events start/end according to your local timezone.
        br
        p.
            I know that lots of you are big fans of TBlazeWarriorT's minion spreadsheet, and so am I! I hope to provide you with a web-based alternative. 
            Although recently inactive, I would try my best to keep my events timer and minions calculator updated and as accurate as possible. Thank you for using my website.
