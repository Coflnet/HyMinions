        h1 ABOUT ME
        p Hello, I have played Hypixel Skyblock the first week of its release. I noticed that it is very important to know the most profitable minion, so I decided to make a calculator myself.
        
        h2 Minion calculator
        .row
            .col-md-9.col-12
                p.
                    It calculates the profit generated by each minion.
                p.
                    What's so special is that it allows you to fully personalize its elements to become your very own minion tier list based on your profile, which include minion tiers, form of products (even in e-block form!), whether or not diamond spreadings are equipped, and more.
                p.
                    It also calculates the profit based on bazaar prices directly obtained from the Hypixel API, so the prices are up-to-date.
                br
                p.
                    To use it, go to the <a href="/minions">minions tab</a>. Type in your Minecraft name in the first input box, so that it could calculate the profit based on your profile's minion tiers, and click "Apply Overall Changes". You will then see a list of all minions, with the first one being the most profitable.
                    The number below the minion name is the profit per hour, assuming you sell the items to the bazaar. You can also see the item(s) each minion gives.
                p.
                    The default settings should be fine for most of you. Of course you can tryout different settings based on your playing habits.

        h2 Events timer
        p A page that shows the time until major events on Skyblock.
        p To use it, go to the <a href="/events">events tab</a>. Live events would be shown in yellow. The large countdown timers show the time left until next event/ time left until the event ends, the small date and time in brackets show the time the event starts/ends according to your timezone.
        br
        p.
            I know that lots of you are big fans of TBlazeWarriorT's minion spreadsheet, and so am I! I hope to provide you with a web-based alternative. 
            Although recently inactive, I would try my best to keep my events timer and minions calculator updated and as accurate as possible. Thank you for using my website.
