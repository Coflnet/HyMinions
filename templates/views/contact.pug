        h2 FAQ
        h4 Q: Why is minion storage not accounted in the minions calculator?
        p A: To my knowledge, the minion storages are not that consistent especially when extra storages and compactors are involved. It may in the future but it requires testing and development time. Therefore, I have not taken minion storages into consideration when calculating the number of items generated currently.

        h4 Q: Is the "estimate by number of minion slots" the minion slots I have?
        p A: No, this is not the minions you have. 23 is the default value as I think that is what some late game players may have.
        p It is an estimation of the minions they have for people who do not want to put their names in. Assuming you craft the minions in ascending order of costs, until you have enough unique minions to unlock the minion slot you specified. 
        p The aim is to exclude exceptionally expensive minions like Voidling Tier 11. However, if you want to get the most out of the calculator, you are advised to enter your Minecraft name so that it can obtain the exact minions you have.
