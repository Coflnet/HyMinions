        h1 About Me
        p Hello, I have been playing Hypixel Skyblock since the first week of its release. I noticed that it's very important to get updated with the most profitable minions, so I decided to make a calculator myself.
        
        h2.d-inline-block Minions Profit Calculator
        p.d-inline-block &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        a(href="/minions"): i.fas.fa-lg.fa-arrow-circle-right
        .row
            .col-md-9.col-12
                p It calculates the profit generated by each minion.
                p What's so special is that it allows you to fully personalize its elements to become your own minion tier list based on your profile, which include minion tiers, form of products (even in e-block form!), offline time, whether or not diamond spreadings are equipped, and more.
                p It also calculates the profit based on bazaar prices directly obtained from the Hypixel API, so the prices are up-to-date.
                p To use the new minion calculator, you could either type in your name and offline duration right on the <a href="/">homepage</a> or go to the <a href="/minions">minions</a> page if you would like to change some settings. (e.g. fuel/ diamond spreading)
                //- p To use it, go to the <a href="/minions">minions tab</a>. Type in your Minecraft IGN in the first input box (or simply leave it if you have fully maxed minions), and click "Apply Overall Changes". You will then see a list of all minions, ranked by the amount of profit it generates. The number below each minion is the profit per hour, assuming you sell the items to the bazaar. You can also see the item(s) each minion gives.
                //- p The default settings should be fine for most of you. Of course you can try out different settings based on your own playstyle.

        h2.d-inline-block Minions Crafts Calculator
        p.d-inline-block &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        a(href="/minionscost"): i.fas.fa-lg.fa-arrow-circle-right
        p It calculates the cheapest minions to level up to gain more minion slots, also tailor-made for each profile if you input your Minecraft name. It also shows you how much money you need to spend on materials to unlock a new minion tier.

        h2.d-inline-block Events Timer
        p.d-inline-block &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        a(href="/events"): i.fas.fa-lg.fa-arrow-circle-right
        p This is the page that shows the time remaining to regular SkyBlock events.
        p To use it, go to the <a href="/events">events tab</a>. Live events are shown in yellow. The large countdown timers show the time left until the next events/ time left until the events end. The bracketed dates and times show when the events start/end according to your local time zone.

        h2 Acknowledgements
        p First of all, I would like to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/_LmqqJtsdrk"> ModernSoldier</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhxDaMPsVxI">Tanker Man 3000</a> for mentioning my website in his video, which has brought me many views.
        p I know that lots of you are big fans of <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/spreadsheet-skyblock-minions-v1-7-added-sky-shiiyu-moe-importer.2166857/">TBlazeWarriorT's minion spreadsheet</a>, and so am I! In fact, I would like to give my compliments to him as Hyminions won't be successful without the minion data provided by the spreadsheet. I would also like to thank <a href="https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Minions">Hypixel Skyblock Wiki</a> for listing out the data as well. Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/api-bazaar-item-names-to-in-game-bazaar-item-json.2845357/">Bozosword and AkaCrafterCZ</a>, who created and maintained a json file to convert the item codes obtained from the bazaar Hypixel API to the conventional item names.
        p Although recently inactive, I would try my best to keep my events timer and minions calculator updated and as accurate as possible. Thank you for using my website.

        h2 Disclaimer
        p As more people are using my website, I would like to explain more about how the minions profit calculator and the minions crafts calculator works and its limitations.
        p Please note that the calculators calculate based on the instantaneous price of the items sold at bazaar, so the prices may fluctuate a lot from time to time, and so do the minions profit/cost (as we all know the economy of Skyblock is quite unstable). The "best minion" for money may not be the same some time later. I hope you all understand this uncertainty.
        p Overall speaking, snow minions and clay minions are the most stable for profit as their profits do not depend on the economy. If you would like to explore other relatively stable alternatives you may watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_LmqqJtsdrk"> ModernSoldier's video</a> for more advice.
