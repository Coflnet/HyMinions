        h3 Notice
        p I am creating a brand new forge page to replace this outdated one. <br />It is currently in its testing phase, you are welcome to <a href="https://discord.gg/2KabAgsN6Y">join my Discord</a> to try out the beta version of the new calculator.
        
        h3 Notes to Users
        p It calculates the net profit and profit per hour generated from crafting items into upgraded version through the forge in the Dwarven Mines. 
        p The prices of the items fluctuate a lot. After forging is finished, the price may be different from now. So there is a risk of suffering from a loss even though the list says you would make a profit.
