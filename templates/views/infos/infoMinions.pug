        p Profit Calculator - Find the best minions to place down while you are offline!

        p It calculates the profit generated by each minion.
        p What's so special is that it allows you to fully personalize its elements to become your own minion tier list based on your profile, which include minion tiers, form of products (even in e-block form!), whether or not diamond spreadings are equipped, and more.
        p It also calculates the profit based on bazaar prices directly obtained from the Hypixel API, so the prices are up-to-date.
        
        p To use the new minion calculator, you could either type in your name and offline duration right on the <a href="/">homepage</a> or go to the <a href="/minions">minions</a> page if you would like to change some settings. (e.g. fuel/ diamond spreading)

        p TL;DR: Default settings should be suitable for most of you. In my opinion, your Minecraft name is the most crucial piece of information to make the calculator useful for you, but it is down to personal preference. If you prefer not to, there is an <a href="#minecraftName">alternative estimation method</a>.

        p As more people are using my website, I would like to explain more about how the minion profit calculator works and its limitations.
        p Please note that the minion profit calculator calculates based on the instantaneous price of the items sold at bazaar, so the prices may fluctuate a lot from time to time, and so do the minions profit (as we all know the economy of Skyblock is quite unstable). The "best minion" for money may not be the same some time later. I hope you all understand this uncertainty.
        p Overall speaking, snow minions and clay minions are the most stable for profit as their profits do not depend on the economy. If you would like to explore other relatively stable alternatives you may watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_LmqqJtsdrk"> ModernSoldier's video</a> for more advice.

        h4 Q: Why is minion storage not accounted in the minions calculator?
        p A: To my knowledge, the minion storages are not that consistent especially when extra storages and compactors are involved. It may in the future but it requires testing and development time. Therefore, I have not taken minion storages into consideration when calculating the number of items generated currently.

        h4 Q: Is the "estimate by number of minion slots" the minion slots I have?
        p A: No, this is not the minions you have. 23 is the default value as I think that is what some late game players may have.
        p It is an estimation of the minions they have for people who do not want to put their names in. Assuming you craft the minions in ascending order of costs, until you have enough unique minions to unlock the minion slot you specified. 
        p The aim is to exclude exceptionally expensive minions like Voidling Tier 11. However, if you want to get the most out of the calculator, you are advised to enter your Minecraft name so that it can obtain the exact minions you have.

        h4 Q: I am an ironman mode player, how can I get NPC prices only?
        p A: There is a "Selling to" setting in the advanced section of the settings, you could change it to "NPC". Alternatively, you could use <a href="/minions?sellingTo=0">this link</a> to have it set automatically.
