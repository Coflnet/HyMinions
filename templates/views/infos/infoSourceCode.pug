        hr
        p HyMinions is built on <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">ExpressJS</a>. 
        p The pages are located under <code>/templates/views</code>. <a href="https://pugjs.org/" target="_blank">Pug.js</a> is used instead of HTML. 
        p The controllers that render the pages can be found under <code>/routes/views</code>.
        p The main logic under each page can be found under  <code>/routes/api</code>.
        p Files with constants on minions and forge items can also be found in <code>/routes/api</code>.
        p You will need to create a <code>.env</code> file, containing a random string labelled <code>COOKIE_SECRET</code>, and your Hypixel API key labelled <code>HYPIXEL_KEY</code>. 
        p The forge page would not work properly because a link to my own backend server is required. However, it will not be shared with you because it is not a free service. Use <a href="/info/api">my API</a> (coming soon) to access information on the forge page. Sorry for the inconvenience.

        //- h3 Q: How often does this website refresh?
        //- p A: Bazaar prices would refresh as long as Hypixel API refreshes. While auction prices are refreshed every 10 minutes. As auction prices are stored in my server while bazaar prices are not.
